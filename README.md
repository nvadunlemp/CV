### Current Position

***Graduate Assistant*** (August 2021 - Present), Department of Geography, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA

-   Run labs for Geographic Information Systems (GEOG 484) and Map Investigation (GEOG 380) including formulating lessons, answering technical questions and grading assignments.

### Research Interests

As a human geographer, I am researching the spatial relationships between people and their urban environments. Specifically, I am interested in how structural processes affect local communities. This has come across in my projects in the form of gentrification, housing and even indigenous rights. My ongoing thesis looks at how the sharing economy, more specifically short-term rentals, are changing the neighborhoods they operate within.
